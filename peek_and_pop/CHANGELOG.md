## [0.0.1] - 05.07.2019

* Initial release. Known issues are:

I) "For devices that don't support Force Press, the package comes with an adaptation to Long Press *however* the Long Press 
version of this package is still under development and is not fully tested yet so consider it as a developers preview."

II) "The "PeekAndPopMoveController" functionality is a very recent addition and therefore it can have unexpected behaviour. 
    An improved version will be submitted shortly."
